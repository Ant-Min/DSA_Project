# DSA_Project

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The purpose of this course was to learn and implement differetn data structures that are available in C++. The project to gauge our understanding was to write a program
that would read a file of class courses (each line consisted of course number, name, and prerequisites) and sort/display the courses using a linked list, hash map, or tree.
With the program itself, a menu was implemented that would give the user options to load the courses into the data structure, display all of the courses, and let the user
search for a particulat course.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I went into the project knowing I wanted to use a BST to sort the classes because it had the best run time of the three data structures we discussed. I did use a vector
at one point to read each line in the file properly before feeding it into the tree, but overall, the efficiency of the tree was the necessary part to consider.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I intiially had issues implementing the BST because I was not used to coding with one to the point I felt overwhelmed. Luckily, I kept calm and used internet resources as a 
guide for how to implement a BST. There was also an assignment before this project where I had to code a tree and there was a reference video that assisted with coding a BST
(I credited that assignment in this project as a comment).

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I think I became more open to data structures as a whole though this course. I had taken a Data Structures course in the past as a Java class, but that class was more about
the fundamnetals of data structures and not so much the implementation of them. With this course, I feel more comfortable about data structures and can see myself practicing
them more going forward. I tend to rely on arrays to the point they are my first thought when programming, but after this course, I plan on being more open to more complex but
efficient ways to organize data.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I think I became more generous with adding comments to my programs after this course. I didn't have trouble using them in past classes and projects, but more detail is always
better for programs overall.
